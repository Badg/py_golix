A NOTE ON RANDOM NUMBERS...
PyCryptoDome sources randomness from os.urandom(). This should be secure
for most applications. HOWEVER, if your system is low on entropy (can
be an issue in high-demand applications like servers), urandom *will not
block to wait for entropy*, and will revert (ish?) to potentially 
insufficiently secure pseudorandom generation. In that case, it might be
better to source from elsewhere (like a hardware RNG).

Some initial temporary thoughts:
1. Need to refactor signing, etc into identities.
2. Identity base class should declare supported cipher suites as a set
3. Each identity class should += the set with their support, allowing
    for easy multi-inheritance for multiple identity support
4. Identities then insert the author into the file
5. How does this interact with asymmetric objects with symmetric sigs?
    Should just look for an instance of the object? It would be nice
    to totally factor crypto awareness out of the objects entirely,
    except (of course) for address algorithms.
6. From within python, should the identies be forced to ONLY support
    a single ciphersuite? That would certainly make life easier. A 
    LOT easier. Yeah, let's do that then. Multi-CS identities can
    multi-subclass, and will need to add some kind of glue code for
    key reuse. Deal with that later, but it'll probably entail 
    backwards-incompatible changes.
7. Then, the identities should also generate secrets. That will also
    remove people from screwing up and using ex. random.random().
    But what to do with the API for that? Should identity.finalize(obj)
    return (key, obj) pair or something? That's not going to be useful
    for all objects though, because not all objects use secrets. Really,
    the question is, how to handle GEOCs in a way that makes sense?
    Maybe add an Identity.secrets(guid) attribute or summat? Though
    returning just the bytes would be really unfortunate for app
    development, because you'd have to unpack the generated bytes to
    figure out the guid. What about returning a namedtuple, and adding
    a field for secrets in the GEOC? that might be something to add
    to the actual objects (ex GEOC) instead of the identity. That would
    also reduce the burden on identities for state management of 
    generated objects, which should really be handled at a higher level
    than this library.
8. Algorithm precedence order should be defined globally, but capable
    of being overwritten
